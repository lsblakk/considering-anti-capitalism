## Considering Anti-Capitalism

Have you ever suspected that the current economic model is not sustainable and that  trusting in free markets is leaving too many people behind?  Do you suspect that there's more that could be **done** to help others and that "pulling yourself up by your bootstraps" just isn't the one-size-fits-all remedy?

There have to be other ways of being in community, of being a society together where people get their needs met and all citizens can be celebrated for their contributions.

We need best practices, we need to break open the boxes of traditional philanthropy, we need new models that can be tested and improved upone but that start with actually doing something and not just talking or debating the merits.  Let merits be decided after there's tangible evidence.
		
Let's start by at least questioning some of the basic assumptions we make and rules we live by which feed capitalism:

* Family
* Inheritance
* Individualism
* Privatization
